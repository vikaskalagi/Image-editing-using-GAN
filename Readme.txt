first trian the DCGAN model and use that weight  to train the  encoder model and then train the attribute encoder model and then to test use the manipulate image 

command to run is given in the particular folder 
i.e 
to train the dcgan go to dcgan folder and run the command which is given in depend.txt file in DCGAN folder
and then use the weight generated from that to trian the encoder and attribute encoder part which is in the ENCODER folder to run the encoder use command which is given in that encoder folder in the file depend.txt
and to test use manipulate.py in the encoder file to run it the command is given in depend.txt file in encoder folder
